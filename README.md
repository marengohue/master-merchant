# ☼ Master merchant ☼
The dwarven merchant game

Goal: obtain a masterwork artifact from one of the in-game towns and bring it home

A card game

10-20 min long games

Single or multiplayer

A turn contains two phases:
 movement and encounters
 Optionally, trade

A player moves a single tile a turn
Each turn a player has to consume one food and one drink from their WAGON per person in their crew.

When he fails to do so, he has to choose one of his crew members who has to die of starvation

When a player himself dies, the game is lost

After the player has moved to a tile, he has to resolve an ENCOUNTER card based on the type of tile he entered

When entering a town, the player can engage in TRADE, exchanging goods with the town.

A player reveals the town's TRADE deck, and does a round of barter based on the value of the items.
There are several rules:
Local goods are cheaper when bought.
You can't buy food from a town when it is starving, in which case the food price goes up. Otherwise you can always buy basic food, and dwarven ale. You can also fill up your barrels with water in town.
Sometimes, there are special modifiers to the towns prices

Every turn, some items are produced in the town and some are consumed.
All the produced items are entering the game face-down unless there is a player in town. Also, each turn a single luxury food item is consumed, when available.

After a while, randomly, artifacts can be produced in the towns and are available for buying. The first player that gets the artifact to his home town wins the game.
