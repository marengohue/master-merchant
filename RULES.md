 # ☼ Master merchant ☼
The dwarven merchant game

Goal: obtain a ☼masterwork☼ artifact from one of the in-game towns and bring it home. The first player (or a team) to do so WINS THE GAME.

A 10-20 min long card game that can be played in either single or multiplayer.

## Initial Setup
- At the start of the game, a random WORLD MAP has to be built by a game master or a third party. (Players should only know the town locations and not the connecting tiles). When building the world initially, all the wilderness tiles are face-down.
- All the towns in play can optionally have multiple MODIFIERS applied to them which affect the way the town is simulated.
- Multiple ENCOUNTER DECKS are built and laid out near the WORLD MAP. The amount of decks is equal to the amount of tile types in play, so if the map consists of FORESTs, PLAINs and TOWNs, there should be three ENCOUNTER DECKS in total.
- For each of the towns in play, a TRADE DECK of items is built. All the trade decks are initially face-down.
- Players have a set of item cards representing the items they own (their WAGON).
- Players have a set of creature cards representing their crew and a single merchant card (the merchant card represents the player's character). Characters can carry items of their own (weapons, armor, etc.).

## Game flow

The game is played in turns and each turn contains the following phases which are played out in parallel (all players move then all players trade, etc):

- Movement phase
- Optional trading phase
- World simulation phase (carried out by the game master)

## Movement
When moving to a wilderness tile, a player has to do the following:
- Consume a food item and a drinks item from his WAGON per crew member or choose a single person out of their crew to die.
- Move to a new spot
- Uncover the tile (turn in face-up)
- Draw and resolve an ENCOUNTER card from the ENCOUNTER DECK of the appropariate type.

After the above steps are done the movement phase is done. If the player's merchant character is dead by the end of the movement phase, the player LOSES THE GAME.

## Trading

When in town, players CAN (but don't have to) trade with the towns folk.
It is done is the following manner:

- A player reveals the town's MODIFIERS
- A player reveals the town's TRADE deck
- Player CAN DO one round of BARTER based on the value of the items (listed on the items).

There are several rules to the trade:
- Local goods (Except for basic FOODS and DRINKS) are cheaper 20% cheaper when bought and sold locally (rounding down, but not cheaper that ☼1).
- Players can buy basic FOOD and DRINK items (Plump helmets and Dwarven Ale) unless the the town modifiers state otherwise.

## World simulation
Every turn, some items are produced in the town and some are consumed (items are drawn randomly unless town modifiers state otherwise)
All the produced items are entering the game face-down unless there is a player in town. Also, each turn a single luxury food item is consumed, when available.
After a while, randomly, artifacts can be produced in the towns and are available for buying.
